About
-----

Adhocracy is a web based software tool which facilitates cooperative policy
drafting, proposal discussion and decisions in distributed groups.

It is primarily developed by the `Liquid Democracy e.V. <http://liqd.de>`_ as a
platform to implement Liquid Democracy concepts, as well as to provide a simple
and working general purpose online participation platform.


Technology
----------

Adhocracy is mostly written in Python 2. It's built on top of many free
software projects, such as the Pylons web framework, the Solr search platform,
Memcached, Redis, many Python libraries and more.


Installing
----------

Adhocracy is known to run on Linux systems, such as Debian Squeeze. It
might run on FreeBSD or OS X, but this hasn't been tested recently.

Installation is usually done through buildout or through an installer script
for Debian based systems. In either case, read `INSTALLATION.rst
<INSTALLATION.rst>`_.
